#### -As the log file was found on the server I used "sniper" attack type on "intruder" tab and clicked into "options" tab and copied the following web traversal manual cheat sheet found in web page https://pentestlab.blog/2012/06/29/directory-traversal-cheat-sheet/ and copied and pasted on Burp Suite via the following to bruteforce the "/etc/password" location. Grep'd "1000" as that is a normal number for a user on a linux machine and found the different "2" which is the correct directory traversal to receive the "/etc/password" credentials:

#### -Copied the raw request from the first "2" 1000 found in the bruteforce and pasted into the "proxy" page of burpsuite and clicked "forward" and the following web page came up showing user "webadmin" along with the password hash.  
 
#### -Copied everything after user "webadmin" and before the first colon (which will be the hash) and pasted into a "hash.txt" file in my kali machine:

#### -I was unable to login to the admin login page with the credentials found but was able to login to SSH with username webadmin and password dragon:
